# Angular Developer Guidelines

## Components

When working with Angular components, consult the following references based on the task:

- **Fundamentals**: Anatomy, metadata, and core concepts. Read [components.md](references/components.md)
- **Inputs**: Signal-based inputs, transforms, and model inputs. Read [inputs.md](references/inputs.md)
- **Outputs**: Signal-based outputs and custom event best practices. Read [outputs.md](references/outputs.md)
- **Host Elements**: Host bindings and attribute injection. Read [host-elements.md](references/host-elements.md)

If you require deeper documentation not found in the references above, read the documentation at `https://angular.dev/guide/components`.

## Forms

When making a forms decision, analyze the project and consider the following guidelines: if the application is using v21 or newer and this is a new form, prefer signal forms. For older applications or when working with existing forms, use the appropriate form type that matches the applications current form strategy.

- **Signal Forms**: Use signals for form state management. Read [signal-forms.md](references/signal-forms.md)
- **Template-driven forms**: Use for simple forms. Read [template-driven-forms.md](references/template-driven-forms.md)
- **Reactive forms**: Use for complex forms. Read [reactive-forms.md](references/reactive-forms.md)

## Dependency Injection

When implementing dependency injection in Angular, follow these guidelines:

- **Fundamentals**: Overview of Dependency Injection, services, and the `inject()` function. Read [di-fundamentals.md](references/di-fundamentals.md)
- **Creating and Using Services**: Creating services, the `providedIn: 'root'` option, and injecting into components or other services. Read [creating-services.md](references/creating-services.md)
- **Defining Dependency Providers**: Automatic vs manual provision, `InjectionToken`, `useClass`, `useValue`, `useFactory`, and scopes. Read [defining-providers.md](references/defining-providers.md)
- **Injection Context**: Where `inject()` is allowed, `runInInjectionContext`, and `assertInInjectionContext`. Read [injection-context.md](references/injection-context.md)
- **Hierarchical Injectors**: The `EnvironmentInjector` vs `ElementInjector`, resolution rules, modifiers (`optional`, `skipSelf`), and `providers` vs `viewProviders`. Read [hierarchical-injectors.md](references/hierarchical-injectors.md)

## Angular Aria

## Routing

When implementing navigation in Angular, consult the following references:

- **Define Routes**: URL paths, static vs dynamic segments, wildcards, and redirects. Read [define-routes.md](references/define-routes.md)
- **Route Loading Strategies**: Eager vs lazy loading, and context-aware loading. Read [loading-strategies.md](references/loading-strategies.md)
- **Show Routes with Outlets**: Using `<router-outlet>`, nested outlets, and named outlets. Read [show-routes-with-outlets.md](references/show-routes-with-outlets.md)
- **Navigate to Routes**: Declarative navigation with `RouterLink` and programmatic navigation with `Router`. Read [navigate-to-routes.md](references/navigate-to-routes.md)
- **Control Route Access with Guards**: Implementing `CanActivate`, `CanMatch`, and other guards for security. Read [route-guards.md](references/route-guards.md)
- **Data Resolvers**: Pre-fetching data before route activation with `ResolveFn`. Read [data-resolvers.md](references/data-resolvers.md)
- **Router Lifecycle and Events**: Chronological order of navigation events and debugging. Read [router-lifecycle.md](references/router-lifecycle.md)
- **Rendering Strategies**: CSR, SSG (Prerendering), and SSR with hydration. Read [rendering-strategies.md](references/rendering-strategies.md)
- **Route Transition Animations**: Enabling and customizing the View Transitions API. Read [route-animations.md](references/route-animations.md)

If you require deeper documentation or more context, visit the [official Angular Routing guide](https://angular.dev/guide/routing).
